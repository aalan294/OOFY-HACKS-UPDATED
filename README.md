# OrgaLink Blockchain Project
Welcome to OrgaLink, a blockchain project developed for OOFY Hacks! This project aims to revolutionize the way organizations interact and share data securely using blockchain technology.

## Setup Instructions
To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install --force` to install deprecated dependencies.
4. After installation, navigate to the `app.js` file in the React app.
5. Locate the `contract` useState and replace the value with the address of the deployed contract.
6. If you haven't already, run the contract separately and register your address as a Hospital using the `registerHospital` function in Remix IDE.
7. Once the setup is complete, you can explore all the functionalities of the project.

## Usage
Since the admin page is not yet created, it's recommended to run the contract separately for administrative tasks like registration. After registering as a Hospital, you can utilize all the functionalities of OrgaLink.
